entry point: app.py

currently tested on only archlinux with KDE

this app give u 12h of sleep per day, 8 sleep and 1.5h of each, then u wake up for 1.5h before going to bed again. (while u can selectively ignore some if u think u have enough sleep)

purpose is to maximize amount of time to sleep in a day with short duration, so more chances to lucid dream

this app will always pop a notification upon starting up or waking from sleep to let u know where on the schedule table ur currently at

it also pop notifications at 1hr and 30min before each sleep time

u should also add these 8 alarms on ur own phone

> 01:30 am - get up
>
> 04:30 am - get up
>
> 07:30 am - get up
>
> 10:30 am - get up
>
> 13:30 pm - get up
>
> 16:30 pm - get up
>
> 19:30 pm - get up
>
> 22:30 pm - get up

in addition to use just this app, u should also

1. record ur dreams by placing a pen and a notebook on ur bed beside u
2. MILD
... maybe more ...
